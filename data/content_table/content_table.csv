mythical-nazis,,,,,,,,,002,DefaultText,"One of the main theses of the anti-Ukrainian propaganda is the assertion that Ukraine is a ""Nazi state"" that infringes on citizens based on nationality and language. The topic of neo-Nazism in Ukraine is twisted by Russian propaganda to absurdity, and the media writes about it a lot. The propaganda mixes together Nazism, nationalism, neo-Nazism and fascism, using all these words when speaking about Ukraine. ",

The participation of the nations of the USSR in World War II is an important part of historical memory for Russia. Every year in Russia there are huge military parades dedicated to the victory over fascism. However, the victory over fascism and national-socialism over the past decades has been turned by the Russian authorities into a cult that does not allow critical analysis. The myth about the fight against Nazism in Ukraine has become a logical continuation of Russian military propaganda.",

Originally, it was the name for members of the ""Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists"" faction, which was led by Stepan Bandera from 1940 to 1959. But already in the USSR, this word was often used in Soviet propaganda. The concept of ""Bandera"" in the USSR gradually became a household word. Later, the term took an important place in Russian political propaganda and is used with a negative connotation. Step by step, members of any power and law enforcement agencies of Ukraine began to be called ""Banderites"", regardless of their attitude towards nationalism. Such a uniform interpretation of history became the basis for accusing the authorities of supporting neo-Nazism and creating the image of an enemy.",
